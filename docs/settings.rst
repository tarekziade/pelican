Settings
########

Pelican is configurable thanks to a configuration file you can pass to
the command line::

    $ pelican -s path/to/your/settingsfile.py path

Settings are given as the form of a python module (a file). You can have an
example by looking at `/samples/pelican.conf.py
<https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican/raw/master/samples/pelican.conf.py>`_

All the settings identifiers must be set in caps, otherwise they will not be
processed.

The settings you define in the configuration file will be passed to the
templates, it allows you to use them to add site-wide contents if you need.

Here is a list of settings for pelican, regarding the different features.

Basic settings
==============

================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        what does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`ARTICLE_PERMALINK_STRUCTURE` (``''``)              Empty by default. Allows to render URLs in a
                                                    particular way, see below.
`AUTHOR`                                            Default author (put your name)
`CLEAN_URLS` (``False``)                            If set to `True`, the URLs will not be suffixed by
                                                    `.html`, so you will have to setup URL rewriting on
                                                    your web server.
`DATE_FORMATS` (``{}``)                             If you do manage multiple languages, you can
                                                    set the date formatting here. See "Date format and locales"
                                                    section below for details.

                                                    settings.
`FALLBACK_ON_FS_DATE` (``True``)                    If True, pelican will use the file system
                                                    dates infos (mtime) if it can't get
                                                    informations from the metadata
`JINJA_EXTENSIONS` (``[]``)                         A list of any Jinja2 extensions you want to use.

                                                    the generated files.
`LOCALE` (''[#]_)                                   Change the locale. A list of locales can be provided
                                                    here or a single string representing one locale.
                                                    When providing a list, all the locales will be tried
                                                    until one works.
`MARKUP` (``('rst', 'md')``)                        A list of available markup languages you want
                                                    to use. For the moment, only available values
                                                    are `rst` and `md`.

                                                    Python-Markdown documentation for a complete list of
                                                    supported extensions.
`OUTPUT_PATH` (``'output/'``)                       Where to output the generated files.
`PATH` (``None``)                                   path to look at for input files.
`PDF_GENERATOR` (``False``)                         Set to True if you want to have PDF versions
                                                    of your documents. You will need to install
                                                    `rst2pdf`.
`RELATIVE_URLS` (``True``)                          Defines if pelican should use relative urls or
                                                    not.
`SITENAME` (``'A Pelican Blog'``)                   Your site name
`SITEURL`                                           base URL of your website. Note that this is
                                                    not a way to tell pelican to use relative urls
                                                    or static ones. You should rather use the
                                                    `RELATIVE_URL` setting for such use.
`STATIC_PAGES` (None)                               A mapping containing static pages that will
                                                    be rendered with the blog entries. See
                                                    :ref:`static_pages`.
`STATIC_PATHS` (``['images']``)                     The static paths you want to have accessible
                                                    on the output path "static". By default,
                                                    pelican will copy the 'images' folder to the
                                                    output folder.
`TIMEZONE`                                          The timezone used in the date information, to
                                                    generate atom and rss feeds. See the "timezone"
                                                    section below for more info.
================================================    =====================================================

.. [#] Default is the system locale. Default is to delete the output directory.

Article permalink structure
---------------------------
Allow to render articles sorted by date, in case you specify a format as
specified in the example.  It follows the python datetime directives:

* %Y: Year with century as a decimal number.
* %m: Month as a decimal number [01,12].
* %d: Day of the month as a decimal number [01,31].

Note: if you specify a datetime directive, it will be substituted using the
date metadata field into the rest file. if the date is not specified, pelican
will rely on the mtime of your file.

Check the python datetime documentation at http://bit.ly/cNcJUC for more
information.

Also, you can use any metadata in the restructured text files:

* category: '%(category)s'
* author: '%(author)s'
* tags: '%(tags)s'
* date: '%(date)s'

Example usage:

* '/%Y/%m/' it will be something like '/2011/07/sample-post.html'.
* '/%Y/%(category)s/' it will be something like '/2011/life/sample-post.html'.

Timezone
--------

If no timezone is defined, UTC is assumed. This means that the generated atom
and rss feeds will have wrong date information if your locale is not UTC.

Pelican issues a warning in case this setting is not defined, as it was not
mandatory in old versions.

Have a look at `the wikipedia page`_ to get a list of values to set your
timezone.

.. _the wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones


Date format and locale
----------------------

If no DATE_FORMAT is set, fallback to DEFAULT_DATE_FORMAT. If you need to
maintain multiple languages with different date format, you can set this dict
using language name (``lang`` in your posts) as key. About available format
codes, see `strftime document of python`_ ::

    DATE_FORMAT = {
        'en': '%a, %d %b %Y',
        'jp': '%Y-%m-%d(%a)',
    }

You can set locale to further control date format::

    LOCALE = ('usa', 'jpn',  # On Windows
        'en_US', 'ja_JP'     # On Unix/Linux
        )

Also, it is possible to set different locale settings for each language, if you
put (locale, format) tuple in dict, and this will override the LOCALE setting
above::

    # On Unix/Linux
    DATE_FORMAT = {
        'en': ('en_US','%a, %d %b %Y'),
        'jp': ('ja_JP','%Y-%m-%d(%a)'),
    }

    # On Windows
    DATE_FORMAT = {
        'en': ('usa','%a, %d %b %Y'),
        'jp': ('jpn','%Y-%m-%d(%a)'),
    }

For available list of `locales on Windows`_ . On Unix/Linux usually you can get
a list of available locales with command ``locale -a``, see manpage `locale(1)`_ for help.

.. _static_pages:

Static pages
============

If you want to generate static pages besides your blog entries, you can point
any HTML or HTML template file with a path pointing to the file and the
URL it will match.

For instance, if you have a blog with four static pages, for a list of
books, your resume and a contact page, you could have::

    STATIC_PAGES = {'/books.html': 'static/books.html',
                    '/resume.html': 'static/resume.html',
                    '/contact.html': 'static/contact.html'}



Feed settings
=============

By default, pelican uses atom feeds. However, it is possible to use RSS feeds
instead, at your covenience.

Pelican generates category feeds as well as feeds for all your articles. It does
not generate feeds for tags per default, but it is possible to do so using
the ``TAG_FEED`` and ``TAG_FEED_RSS`` settings:


================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        what does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`CATEGORY_FEED` ('feeds/%s.atom.xml'[2]_)           Where to put the atom categories feeds.
`CATEGORY_FEED_RSS` (``None``, i.e. no RSS)         Where to put the categories rss feeds.
`FEED` (``'feeds/all.atom.xml'``)                   relative url to output the atom feed.
`FEED_RSS` (``None``, i.e. no RSS)                  relative url to output the rss feed.
`TAG_FEED` (``None``, ie no tag feed)               relative url to output the tags atom feed. It should
                                                    be defined using a "%s" matchin the tag name
`TAG_FEED_RSS` (``None``, ie no RSS tag feed)       relative url to output the tag RSS feed
`FEED_MAX_ITEMS`                                    Maximum number of items allowed in a feed. Feeds are
                                                    unrestricted by default.
================================================    =====================================================

.. [2] %s is the name of the category.

Pagination
==========

The default behaviour of pelican is to list all the articles titles alongside
with a short description of them on the index page. While it works pretty well
for little to medium blogs, it is convenient to have a way to paginate this.

You can use the following settings to configure the pagination.

================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        what does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`DEFAULT_ORPHANS` (0)                               The minimum number of articles allowed on the
                                                    last page. Use this when you don't want to
                                                    have a last page with very few articles.
`DEFAULT_PAGINATION` (False)                        The maximum number of articles to include on a
                                                    page, not including orphans. False to disable
                                                    pagination.
================================================    =====================================================

Tag cloud
=========

If you want to generate a tag cloud with all your tags, you can do so using the
following settings.

================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        what does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`TAG_CLOUD_STEPS` (4)                               Count of different font sizes in the tag
                                                    cloud.
`TAG_CLOUD_MAX_ITEMS` (100)                         Maximum tags count in the cloud.
================================================    =====================================================

The default theme does not support tag clouds, but it is pretty easy to add::

    <ul>
        {% for tag in tag_cloud %}
            <li class="tag-{{ tag.1 }}"><a href="/tag/{{ tag.0 }}/">{{ tag.0 }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>

You should then also define a CSS with the appropriate classes (tag-0 to tag-N, where
N matches `TAG_CLOUD_STEPS` -1.

Translations
============

Pelican offers a way to translate articles. See the section on getting started for
more information about that.

================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        what does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`DEFAULT_LANG` (``'en'``)                           The default language to use.
`TRANSLATION_FEED` ('feeds/all-%s.atom.xml'[3]_)    Where to put the RSS feed for translations.
================================================    =====================================================

.. [3] %s is the language

Ordering contents
=================

================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        what does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`REVERSE_ARCHIVE_ORDER` (``False``)                 Reverse the archives order. (True makes it in
                                                    descending order: the newer first)
`REVERSE_CATEGORY_ORDER` (``False``)                Reverse the category order. (True makes it in
                                                    descending order, default is alphabetically)
================================================    =====================================================

Theming
=======

Theming is addressed in a dedicated section (see :ref:`theming-pelican`).
However, here are the settings that are related to theming.

================================================    =====================================================
Setting name (default value)                        what does it do?
================================================    =====================================================
`THEME`                                             theme to use to produce the output. can be the
                                                    complete static path to a theme folder, or
                                                    chosen between the list of default themes (see
                                                    below)
`THEME_STATIC_PATHS` (``['static']``)               Static theme paths you want to copy. Default
                                                    values is `static`, but if your theme has
                                                    other static paths, you can put them here.
`CSS_FILE` (``'main.css'``)                         specify the CSS file you want to load
================================================    =====================================================

By default, two themes are availablee. You can specify them using the `-t` option:

* notmyidea
* simple (a synonym for "full text" :)

You can define your own theme too, and specify it's emplacement in the same
way (be sure to specify the full absolute path to it).

Here is `a guide on how to create your theme
<http://alexis.notmyidea.org/pelican/themes.html>`_

You can find a list of themes at http://github.com/ametaireau/pelican-themes.

Pelican comes with :doc:`pelican-themes` a small script for managing themes.

The `notmyidea` theme can make good use of the following settings. I recommend
to use them too in your themes.

=======================   =======================================================
Setting name              what does it do ?
=======================   =======================================================
`DISQUS_SITENAME`         Pelican can handle disqus comments, specify the
                          sitename you've filled in on disqus
`GITHUB_URL`              Your github URL (if you have one), it will then
                          use it to create a github ribbon.
`GOOGLE_ANALYTICS`        'UA-XXXX-YYYY' to activate google analytics.
`MENUITEMS`               A list of tuples (Title, Url) for additional menu
                          items to appear at the beginning of the main menu.
`PIWIK_URL`               URL to your Piwik server - without 'http://' at the
                          beginning.
`PIWIK_SSL_URL`           If the SSL-URL differs from the normal Piwik-URL
                          you have to include this setting too. (optional)
`PIWIK_SITE_ID`           ID for the monitored website. You can find the ID
                          in the Piwik admin interface > settings > websites.
`LINKS`                   A list of tuples (Title, Url) for links to appear on
                          the header.
`SOCIAL`                  A list of tuples (Title, Url) to appear in the
                          "social" section.
`TWITTER_USERNAME`        Allows to add a button on the articles to tweet about
                          them. Add you twitter username if you want this
                          button to appear.
=======================   =======================================================

In addition, you can use the "wide" version of the `notmyidea` theme, by
adding that in your configuration::

    CSS_FILE = "wide.css"
